# ezrab_feedbc Project Brain Food

Feed BC is a provincial government partnership initiative led by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, to increase B.C. food in hospitals, residential care facilities, public post-secondary institutions, and other government-supported facilities.

This code repository contains the most current version of the files used for the site hosting of VIU Food Service's Project Brain Food implementation.
 
 The heart of the application, the interactive map is a JavaScript vector map which displays dynamically generated Advanced Map Markers and a corresponding map legend. Each marker and legend item will bring up information about the selected food supplier and will show their location on our food map.
